A search for the top squark from direct production via the all-hadronic decay channel is performed on 136.7 $\text{fb}^{-1}$ at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV from Run 2 of the LHC. Events are categorized into exclusive regions designed to optimize the different search topologies of the analysis. The analysis concentrates on identifying heavy objects such as top quarks and W boson, from their decays using a custom tagger for resolved tops and multivariate methods for others. A low $\Delta m$ spectra is enhanced using the soft $b$ quark jet transverse momentum which is typical of signal in a boosted regime with initial-state radiation. We then provide exclusion limits for each signal in the simplified models with multiple decay products.
