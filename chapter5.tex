\section{Production and Decay Modes}
\label{sec:Production}

Gluon fusion.

Main decay mode mode $\st\rightarrow t+\neutralino$, $\st\rightarrow b+\chargino$. The top quark most likely decays into a b quark and W boson. 

\section{Standard Model Background}
\label{sec:SMBackground}

Signal events can be mimicked by SM events that have a large number of jets and missing energy. 

Broken up into four major backgrounds, Lost Lepton (LL), Znunu, QCD, Rare decays

\subsection{Lost Lepton}
\label{subsec:LL}

The contribution from the \ttbar{} and \W+jets processes arises from leptonic decays of the \W boson where the charged lepton is outside the kinematic acceptance of CMS or evades identificaiton by the dedicated lepton vetoes. Large \met can be generated by the associated neutrino and the lepton that is not reconstructed, allowing such events to enter the search regions. This background is collectively referred to as the "Lost Lepton" (LL) background. Contributions arising from $ttW$ and single-top processes also enter into this category, but with much smaller importance. 

Studies in simulation indicate that the event kinematics for different lepton flavors are similar enough to allow us to estimate them collectively from a single control sample in data that has event characteristics similar to those of the search sample. Because of this, we use the single-lepton control sample to estimate the LL background, using the method descrived in detail in Ref. [18]. The single-lepton sample consists of events that have one lepton satisfying the lepton-veto criteria. In order to suppress potential signal contamination, we require $M_T(l,\met)<100 \GeV$. If there is more than one selected lepton, we randomly select which lepton is chosen to determine the $M_T(l,\met)$. The requirement of low $M_T(l,\met)$ also ensures orthogonality to the search regions used in the search for direct top squark production in the single-lepton final state, making it possible to statistically combine the results of the two searches. The selection applied to the single-lepton control sample follows the same selection on the search variables as in the zero-lepton selection with the exception of classification according to the number of top and \W-tagged candidates. 

\subsubsection{Transfer Factors}
\label{subsec:TF}

The LL estimation in each search region is based upon the event count in data in the corresponding control region in the single-lepton sample. The count is extrapolated to the search region to obtain a prediction by means of a transfer factor obtained from simulation samples as follows: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:LLTF}
N_{pred}^{LL}=TF_{LL} \cdot N_{data}(1l).
\end{equation}

We want to suppress signal contamination by requiring $M_{T}(l, \met) < 100$ GeV. This requirement confirms that it is orthogonal to the search reagions that are used in the search for direct top squark production in the single-lepton final state. Letting the two anaysis statistically combine the results in the future. 

This allows us to have the same selection for the single-lepton control sample and the zero-lepton sample. The only exception is the number of top and W-tagged candidates? what is the difference betweeen a candidate and a particle?

The LL estimation is dependent on the yield of data in the corresponding CR and the TF calculated by the single-lepton sample. The transfer factor is defined as, 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:TF}
TF_{LL}=\frac{N_{MC}(0l)}{N_{MC}(1l)},
\end{equation}

where $N_{MC}(1l)$ is the event count observed in the corresponding CR and $N_{MC}(0l)$ use the event count in the corresponding SR.

\subsection{Z Boson Decay to Neutrinos}
\label{subsec:Znunu}

An important source of background for the zero-lepton search is from events in which a \Z{} boson, produced in association with jets, decays to neutrinos that result in a significant amount of missing energy in the event. Two methods are traditionally used to estimate the \Znunu{} background. The first method makes use of a sample dominated by \Zll+jets events. This approach comes with the advantage of very similar kinematics (after correcting for the difference in acceptance between charged lepton pairs and pairs of neutrinos), but is statistically limited, especially in the tight search regions used in SUSY searches. The second method utilizes a $\gamma+$jets sample. The $\gamma+$jets process has a factor of 5 or more larger cross section than the \Zll+jets process, and has similar leading order Feynman diagrams to \Z+jets events. However, there are two main differences between the two processes that must be taken into account, namely, different quark-boson couplings and the fact that the \Z{} boson is very massive. Both of these effects become less important with higher boson \pt, which is the kinematic region we are probing with this search. The \met{} of the $\gamma+$jets process is calculated after removing the photon from the event to mimic the \Znunu{} process.

Based on the above, we use a hybrid method to estimate the \Znunu{} background that makes use of both the $\gamma+$jets and the \Zll+jets processes. The photon and the dilepton system are removed from the events before calculating \met{} and other kinematic variables related to \met, and the modified \met{} is denoted by $\met^\gamma$ and $\met^{ll}$ for $\gamma+$jets and the \Zll+jets processes, respectively. We utilize the \Zll+jets sample to measure the normalization of the \Znunu{} process in different ranges of \nb{} and \nsv, andwe take advantage of the much higher statistics of the $\gamma+$jets sample to extract shape corrections. As discussed in Sec. , the good agreement we observe between data and simulation in the Lost Lepton background leads us to integrate the control regions used in the estimation of the \Znunu{} background in the number of $t$ and \W{} tags to increase the statistical power of the prediction. We then extrapolate into tagged regions using simulation, corrected with the appropriate $t$ and \W{} tagging data-to-simulation scale factors.

The prediction of the \Znunu{} background is given by:
\begin{equation}
N_{pred}^{\Znunu}=N_{MC}^{\Znunu} \cdot R_Z \cdot S_\gamma
\end{equation}

Znunu: production of a Z boson that decays into two nuetrinos which are then missed by the detector. Can have jets from other quarks/gluons in the interaction

\subsection{Quantum Chromodynamic Events}
\label{subsec:QCD}

QCD: Events that of jets produced by QCD processes. The missing energy from from a mismeasurement of the jets in the event causing missing energy

\subsection{Rare Interactions}
\label{subsec:rare}

ttZ, ttH, WW, WZ, ZZ, tZq, tWZ: rare processed that can have jets plus MET. Expand upon these later
