\chapter{Compact Muon Solenoid}
\label{ch:CMS}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:cmsIntro}

Located near Geneva, switzerland as part of the CERN collaboration. LHC provides proton beams

General CMS facts. What kind of particles is it meant to detect? What are the subdetectors? Tracker, ECAL, HCAL, superconducting solenoid, muon chambers

\section{Silicon Tracker}
\label{sec:Tracker}

\subsection{Pixel Detector}
\label{subsec:Pixel}

What is it?
Newly installed pixel detector. Larger particle flux and data rate. What is the design of the modules? How do they work?
Increased efficiency for B tagging.

\subsection{Silicon Strips}
\label{subsec:Strips}

How is it different from the pixels?
