\chapter{Validation and Estimation}
\label{ch:ValandEst}

In order to test and validate the background estimation strategy in data, we carry out the background estimation method in a lower \met{} region of the zero-lepton sample that is adjacent to the search sample, the "low \met{} validation sample", and check the agreement between data and background prediciton. The validaiton sample has significantly larger statistics than the search sample and is signal-depleted. Apart from the difference in the \met{} selection, the search selection on the other search variables is applied to the validation sample, with an exception of the regions with more than one top- or W-tags, where relaxed selections (i.e. drop selection in $M_T(b_{1,2},\met)$) are applied to gain more statistics. Figgure ? displays the SM estimate and the observed data in the different validation regions. Statistical uncertainties as well as systematic uncertainties resulting from the top- and W-tagging correciton in the background predictions are shown in this plot. The data agrees well with the estimated backgrounds yields within uncertainties.
