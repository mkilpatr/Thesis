\subsection{Filters}
The following filters, recommended by the JetMET POG, are applied to 2016, 2017, and 2018 eras:
\begin{itemize}
	\item goodVertices where the event is required to have $|z|\leq24$;
	\item HBHENoiseFilter, to reduce bad pulse-shape, timing, and hit multiplicity;
	\item HBHENoiseIsoFilter, to include a requirement on the number of isolated noise channels;
	\item EcalDeadCellTriggerPrimitiveFilter, to remove events where the energy measured in the ECAL is biases due to energy deposits in dead cell regions;
	\item BadPFMuonFilter, to remove badly reconstructed muons from the PF algorithm;
	\item GlobalSuperTightHalo2016Filter, to minimize effects of the beam halo which is a process when partons interact upstream of the detector; and
	\item eeBadScFilter, to remove crystals that are determined to be erroneous.
\end{itemize}
There is an addition ecalBadCalibFilter for 2017 and 2018 eras only for additional bad calorimeters for those years of data.
